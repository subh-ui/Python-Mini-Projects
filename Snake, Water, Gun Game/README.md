# ðŸŽ® Snake, Water, and Gun Game

This is a simple terminal-based Snake, Water, and Gun game built using basic Python.

It's a fun twist on the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors concept:

â€¢	Snake drinks Water

â€¢	Water douses Gun

â€¢	Gun kills Snake


ðŸ§  Game Logic

â€¢	The user plays against the computer.

â€¢	Choices are made using keyboard input (s, w, or g).

â€¢	The computer randomly selects its choice.

â€¢	The game then determines the winner based on standard rules.

â€¢	Scores are tracked and displayed after each round.


ðŸ›  Key Concepts Used

â€¢	'random' module for computer choice generation

â€¢	Conditional statements for game logic

â€¢	Looping for multiple rounds

â€¢	Input/output handling in the console


This project is perfect for beginners to practice control flow, logic building, and interactive Python scripting.
